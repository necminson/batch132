    // public: It means it can be used from entire the project.(public library)
    //         There is no restriction to use it.
    //         "public" is one of the "access modifier"s

    //default : It means it is open to a group.(Harvard University library)
    //          If you make something "default" in Java, it will be used just inside the package.
    //          To make something "default" in Java ,do not type any access modifier.

    //protected:    It means it is open to a group and their kids.(Gym is open to employees and their kids)

    //private : It means it is specific for a person.(driving license)
    //          If you make something "private" you can use it while you are in the class.
    //          When you outside class it is impossible to use it.
